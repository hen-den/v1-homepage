# V1-Homepage

This project contains the source code of the homepage of Mertkan Henden, which can be found under [https://mertkan-henden.com/](https://mertkan-henden.com/)


## Description

The homepage uses React JS, SCSS & HTML to introduce everyone to the focus topics of Mertkan Henden.
The initial design was inspired by Brittany Chiang and her v3 of her homepage. 
Her initial project used Jekyll and therefore I adjusted all the source code to work in React JS and also enhanced the design to my needs.
Please also have a look on her repository under [https://github.com/bchiang7/v3](https://github.com/bchiang7/v3).
