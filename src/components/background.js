                    As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my
                    technical knowledge
                    with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications
                    that are scalable
                    and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

                    or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
